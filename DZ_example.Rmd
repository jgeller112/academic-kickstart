Here is the sample text you provided
```{r}
library(stringr) #load this library

dz=read.csv("/Users/jgeller1/Downloads/DZ.csv")

head(dz$letters)# what is contained in file



```

We can clean up the text between by calling this: 

```{r}

remove_chars=gsub("<[^>]+>", "",dz$letters)

remove_chars

```

This removed everything between "<>" as requested. However, there is still some junk left over. You can replace these by calling: 

```{r}

library(stringr)

remove_chars1 <- str_replace_all(remove_chars, "[[:punct:]]", " ")

remove_chars1


```
