# Biography
I am currently a Research Scientist at Rutgers University Center for Cognitive Science (RuCCS). My research program investigates the cognitive and neurological underpinnings of langauge processing (i.e., visual and auditory word recognition). I am also interested in human memory with foci on semantics, metacognition, and desirable difficulties

My philosophy is that cognition is best understood by looking at both behavior and the brain. To get a better understanding of cognition I use a multi-method approach that involves using standard behavioral measurements (e.g., reaction times), eye-tracking, neuroimaging, and physiological indices (e.g., pupillometry,EEG/sEEG).
